# Snake Game

Do you remember the snake game that we used to play on Nokia 1100? If you recall it, then this project is exactly the same replica of that game. The task is to make the snake move towards the food and consume it. As a result, the snake gets elongated as it consumes the food. Enjoy playing the game. My Highest Score is 680. Let's see if you can beat that!
